# CG2271-Project

Description: A robotic car which could be controlled via a phone application as well as having an auto-pilot mode. When the auto-pilot mode is turned on, the robotic car drives towards an obstacle before circling around it and driving back in the original direction. The robotic car would then stop once it detects another obstacle.
